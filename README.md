# **Find Me A Linux Distro**

[Find Me A Linux Distro](https://kripc2160.github.io/fmald.html), or **FMALD** for short, is a website that finds random linux distribution. 

## UPDATE: The project is no longer maintained here, however it can be found in my [personal website](https://kripc2160.github.com/fmald.html)

There is now a fork of this project maintained by [MiguelCarino](https://github.com/MiguelCarino/) which you can find in [distro.moe](https://distro.moe/). If you have any suggestions or changes, make sure to do so in [MiguelCarino/findmeadistro](https://github.com/MiguelCarino/findmeadistro).

These distributions might be ones you know and use, remixes of distributions, country exclusive, and so much more. ~~FMALD is still needs more distributions so if you have any distribution you want to be in the website, make sure to put them in the [issues](https://github.com/KripC2160/findmealinuxdistro/issues).~~ The Linux distributions however still are focused on ones that run on computer (so no server or mobile Linux). 
Feedbacks are welcome :D
