# **Find Me A Distro**
[Find Me A Distro]("https://distro.moe"), or **FMAD** for short, is a website that finds random Unix/GNU+linux distributions. This is a fork from Find Me A Linux Distro ("https://github.com/KripC2160/findmealinuxdistro") by KripC2160 ("https://github.com/KripC2160/").

These distributions might be ones you know and use, remixes of distributions, country exclusive, and so much more. FMALD is still needs more distributions so if you have any distribution you want to be in the website, make sure to put them in the [issues](https://github.com/MiguelCarino/findmeadistro/issues). The Linux distributions however still are focused on ones that run on workstations mostly x86_64 architecture (Server images and other architectures may appear but are not the focus).
Feedback is welcome.
